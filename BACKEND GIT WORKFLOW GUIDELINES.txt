BACKEND GIT WORKFLOW GUIDELINES
Project: Global Connect Ethiopia – Event Hub

1. PURPOSE
This document defines the Git collaboration workflow for backend development.
The goal is to ensure:
●	Clean code integration
●	No direct production changes
●	Safe collaboration
●	Structured feature development
●	Professional engineering standards
All team members must follow this workflow.

2. CORE PRINCIPLE
We DO NOT work directly on the main branch.
Branch purposes:
●	main → Production-ready stable code
●	develop → Integration and testing branch
●	feature/* → Individual developer task branches
All changes must go through a Pull Request (PR).
3. BRANCH STRUCTURE
main
↑
develop
↑
feature/auth-engine
feature/rbac-profile
feature/workflow-engine
4. DEVELOPER WORKFLOW (STEP-BY-STEP)
Step 1 – Get Latest Code
Before starting any task:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

Step 2 – Create Your Feature Branch
Each task must have its own branch.
Example:
Dev-1 (Auth & DB):
git checkout -b feature/auth-engine

Dev-2 (RBAC & Profile):
git checkout -b feature/rbac-profile

Branch naming format:
feature/task-name

Keep names short and descriptive.
Step 3 – Work & Commit Properly
Commit message format:
●	feat: add JWT authentication
●	feat: implement bcrypt hashing
●	fix: resolve login validation bug
●	refactor: restructure user schema
Example:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement JWT login logic"

Commit often and keep changes small.
Step 4 – Push Your Branch
git push -u origin feature/auth-engine

Step 5 – Create Pull Request
On GitHub:
Create PR from:
feature/auth-engine → develop

Requirements:
●	Add description of what was implemented
●	Request review from teammate
●	Do not merge your own PR without review (if possible)
5. PROTECTED RULES
The following actions are NOT allowed:
●	Direct push to main
●	Direct push to develop
●	Merge without Pull Request
●	Large unreviewed commits
main branch must be protected in repository settings.
6. WEEKLY INTEGRATION PROCESS (SUNDAY SYNC)
Every Sunday:
1.	Merge all approved feature branches into develop
2.	Perform integration testing
3.	Verify APIs, database, authentication, and role permissions
4.	If stable, merge develop → main
5.	Create version tag
Example:
git tag v1.0-auth-phase
git push origin v1.0-auth-phase


7. TASK-BASED BRANCH STRATEGY (PHASE 1 EXAMPLE)
Dev-1 Tasks:
●	feature/auth-jwt
●	feature/mongodb-schema
Dev-2 Tasks:
●	feature/rbac-middleware
●	feature/profile-crud
Each branch should focus on ONE logical feature only.
8. MERGE CONFLICT HANDLING
If conflict occurs:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/your-branch
git merge develop

Resolve conflicts manually → commit → push again.
Conflicts are normal. Do not panic.
9. REPOSITORY CLEANLINESS RULES
Never commit:
●	venv/
●	.env
●	pycache/
●	node_modules/ (if frontend later)
Ensure .gitignore is configured correctly.
10. TEAM ENGINEERING CULTURE
We:
●	Write meaningful commit messages
●	Keep branches short-lived
●	Review each other's work
●	Test before merging
●	Respect the branch structure
●	Communicate before major changes
Professional collaboration is more important than speed.
11. FINAL WORKFLOW SUMMARY
1.	Pull from develop
2.	Create feature branch
3.	Code
4.	Commit properly
5.	Push branch
6.	Create PR to develop
7.	Review & merge
8.	Weekly merge develop → main
